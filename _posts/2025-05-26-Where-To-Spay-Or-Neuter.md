Thinking about spaying or neutering your beloved pet but unsure where to start? 

Many pet parents share concerns about the cost or simply don't know where to avail of these vital services. The good news is, finding a trusted clinic in Metro Manila is easier than you think! 


# For free kapon, check out your city or town veterinary office 
Many **Local Government Units (LGUs)**  offer free or heavily subsidized "kapon" programs. 

Here in Pasig, the Veterinary Services Department of Pasig City, not only provides free kapon but residents can also avail of free micro-chipping and anti-rabies vaccination for their pets.

# Private Clinics 
While LGU's provide free kapon, not everyone might be able to avail due to limited schedule and quotas. Private veterinary clinics offer a reliable alternative. The cost of spay and neuter procedures (kapon) in Metro Manila can vary depending on factors like the animal's breed, size, and any additional complications. 

Generally, as of 2025, expect to pay between P700 to P3,500 for a cat and P1,000 to P5,000 for a dog. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Cat:**
- Puspin Female: P1,000
- Puspin Male: P700
- Mixed/Purebred: May incur an additional fee of P500.

**Dog:**
- Aspin Female:
  > P1,500 (up to 15kg),
  > P2,000 (16-20kg),
  > P2,500 (21-24kg),
  > P5,000 (25-35kg)

- Aspin Male:
  > P1,000 (up to 15kg),
  > P1,500 (16-20kg)

- Mixed/Purebred: May incur an additional fee of P1,000.


*Keep in mind that certain circumstances may lead to extra fees, like:*
- **Pregnant Animals:** e.g. P500 for pregnant cats, P1,000 for pregnant dogs
- **Undescended Testicles:** e.g. P300-P500 for male cats, P500-P1000 for male dogs
- **Pyometra:** e.g. P500 for female cats, P1,000 for female dogs
